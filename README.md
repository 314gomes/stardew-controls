# Stardew Controls

This is a small project to demonstrate the controls subject I am learning at university using a clone of Stardew Valley's fishing minigame.

## Project Overview

The project aims to replicate the fishing minigame from Stardew Valley to explore and understand various control mechanisms and their implementations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the setup guide. You will need to install [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to run the game.
